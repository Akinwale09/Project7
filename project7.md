## DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION
#### In previous Project, Project 6, I implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. Moving further I will add some more value to my solutions that DevOps team could utilize. I want to introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help a team in day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.

### Setup and technologies used in my Project 7
#### As a member of a DevOps team, I will implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessible.

### In this project I will implement a solution that consists of following components:

#### 1. Infrastructure: AWS
#### 2. Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
#### 3. Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
#### 4. Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
#### 5. Programming Language: PHP
#### 6. Code Repository: GitHub

### I Spin up all the required servers, 1 NFS Server, 3 Webserver and 1 Database server as below:
